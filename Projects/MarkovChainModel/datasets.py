sample2 = """I can write anything here, it´s amazing to thing I am listening to music meanwhile I am building a very simple ML system at the time I practice my writed English, because I am doing three things at time, it is easy to do on this aproach, I am learning, engaging and growing up my skills wether professional or personal."""

sample3 = """Learning programming offers numerous benefits. It enhances problem-solving skills, boosts logical thinking, and improves creativity. Many industries now require programming knowledge, making it a valuable career skill. Programming also allows people to automate repetitive tasks, increasing efficiency. Moreover, it provides opportunities for innovation, enabling individuals to create applications, websites, and software that can impact millions. By learning to code, people develop resilience and perseverance, as debugging and solving challenges are part of the process. In an increasingly digital world, programming literacy empowers individuals to understand and shape technology rather than just consume it."""

sample4 = """Humanity has always looked beyond Earth, dreaming of interstellar travel. Scientists and engineers are developing new propulsion technologies to make deep space travel a reality. Concepts such as warp drives, ion thrusters, and antimatter propulsion could help us reach distant exoplanets. Space agencies like NASA and private companies are investing in research to build sustainable space habitats and spacecraft capable of long-duration missions. The search for habitable planets fuels the desire to explore the cosmos, ensuring the survival of humanity in case of planetary catastrophes. While challenges such as cosmic radiation and vast distances remain, interstellar travel may one day become humanity’s greatest achievement."""
